/*
Deprecated options are features or settings in a software library or

In your case:

useNewUrlParser: This option was used to enable the new URL string parser for MongoDB connections. In newer versions of the MongoDB Node.js driver, the new parser is the default, so this option is no longer necessary.

When options are deprecated, itâ€™s a good idea to remove them from your code to avoid warnings and ensure compatibility with future releases. If you see a deprecation warning, it's generally a
